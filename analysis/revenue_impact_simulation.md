# Revenue Impact & Profit Simulation

> Executive Summary:
>
> A 15% exposure increase in the highest-margin revenue-driving category produces ~6.9% revenue growth and meaningful gross profit lift without additional fixed cost.
>
> Mix optimization demonstrates leverage beyond traffic-based growth strategies.

## Baseline Revenue (4-Day Sample)

Total Revenue by Category:

- Cocktails: 3,456
- Champagne: 9,440
- Spirits: 2,772
- Food: 1,064
- Service: 3,800

Total Revenue = 20,532

---

## Scenario: 15% Increase in Champagne Velocity

Baseline Champagne Revenue = 9,440

Projected Revenue:
9,440 × 1.15 = 10,856

Incremental Revenue Gain:
10,856 - 9,440 = 1,416

New Total Revenue:
20,532 → 21,948

Revenue Growth = +6.9%

---

## Gross Profit Impact

Baseline Margin per Unit (Champagne):
160 - 90 = 70

Gross Profit Increase Estimate:
1,416 × (70 / 160) ≈ 619

This illustrates how targeted mix optimization produces disproportionate profitability gains.

## Sensitivity Analysis

| Exposure Increase | Revenue Growth |
|------------------|---------------|
| 5%               | +2.3%         |
| 10%              | +4.6%         |
| 15%              | +6.9%         |
| 20%              | +9.2%         |

## Strategic Implication

Revenue growth does not require traffic growth.

It requires:
- Margin-aware exposure
- Incentive alignment
- Velocity optimization
- Repeatable weekly review cadence

This model scales across multiple locations without increasing fixed cost.
