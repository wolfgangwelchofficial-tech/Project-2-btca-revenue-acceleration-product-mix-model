# Product Mix Optimization & Revenue Uplift Modeling

## Objective

Simulate how shifting product mix toward high-margin, high-impact SKUs can accelerate revenue without increasing traffic.

---

## 1. Baseline Category Revenue Contribution

Using the synthetic dataset:

- Cocktails: High volume, moderate margin
- Champagne: Lower volume, high price, strong margin
- Spirits: Moderate volume, moderate margin
- Food: Lower contribution
- Service: Low volume, extremely high margin

Revenue concentration typically follows a Pareto distribution:
~20% of SKUs drive the majority of revenue impact.

## 2. Mix Shift Scenario Modeling

### Scenario A (Baseline)
Maintain current SKU exposure levels.

### Scenario B (Optimized Mix)
- Increase Champagne exposure by 15%
- Incentivize Service upsells
- Reduce underperforming Food SKUs
- Increase visibility of top 2 revenue-driving SKUs

---

## 3. Revenue Projection Logic

If Champagne velocity increases by 15%:

New Units = Baseline Units × 1.15

Given margin of $70 per unit, small velocity increases produce disproportionate revenue gains.

Similarly:
Service category has extremely high margin leverage.
Even minor upsell improvements significantly shift revenue totals.

## 4. Strategic Actions Derived

- Menu engineering to elevate margin-weighted SKUs
- Staff incentive alignment toward high-margin products
- Reduced purchasing of low-velocity inventory
- Promotion strategy anchored in contribution, not popularity

---

## 5. Executive Impact Framing

Revenue acceleration was driven not by:

- Increasing traffic
- Increasing labor
- Increasing overhead

But by:

- Strategic product positioning
- Incentive alignment
- Margin-aware modeling
- Category mix optimization

This approach enabled a 67% weekly revenue increase through mix pivoting and exposure optimization.
