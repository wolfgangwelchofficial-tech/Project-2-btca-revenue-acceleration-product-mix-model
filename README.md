# BT-California — Revenue Acceleration & Product Mix Optimization (Case Study)

> This repository demonstrates how SKU velocity modeling and product mix analysis can drive measurable revenue acceleration through data-driven decision-making.  
> Synthetic dataset used for demonstration purposes.

## Executive Summary

A review of historical sales performance revealed uneven revenue contribution across SKUs and categories.  
Instead of optimizing “sales per head,” the strategy pivoted to:

- Identify high-velocity SKUs
- Increase exposure and availability of top performers
- Reduce low-performing inventory drag
- Shift revenue mix toward higher-margin categories

The result (from role experience):  
**67% increase in weekly revenue ($30K → $50K) driven by product mix optimization and strategic positioning.**

## Business Problem

Revenue growth had plateaued due to:
- Overweight exposure to low-velocity SKUs
- Inventory allocation not aligned with demand
- Incentives not aligned to high-margin products

The key question:

> Which SKUs and categories actually drive growth — and how should we shift mix to accelerate revenue?

## Analytical Approach

## Analytical Framework

This case study is structured across three analytical layers:

- [SKU Velocity & Margin Modeling](analysis/sku_velocity_calcs.md)  
  Identifies demand strength and profitability concentration.

- [Product Mix Optimization Strategy](analysis/product_mix_analysis.md)  
  Defines exposure adjustments and strategic mix pivots.

- [Revenue Impact & Profit Simulation](analysis/revenue_impact_simulation.md)  
  Quantifies projected uplift and margin leverage under multiple scenarios.

## Core Metrics Modeled

- **SKU Velocity**
- **Revenue Contribution %**
- **Category Mix %**
- **Revenue per SKU**
- **Projected Mix Shift Uplift**

## Revenue Distribution Snapshot

![Revenue by SKU](visuals/revenue-by-sku.png)

Source: Synthetic dataset — data/sales_by_sku_daily.csv

This visualization highlights revenue concentration across categories, reinforcing the importance of margin-weighted product mix optimization.

Champagne represents approximately 44% of total revenue in the sample despite lower unit velocity, highlighting revenue concentration and the leverage potential of high-margin categories.

## Decision Execution Model

Operational decisions are documented in:

- [Revenue Acceleration Playbook](docs/decision_playbook.md)

This framework translates analytical insights into repeatable weekly execution.

---

## Data Inputs

Synthetic datasets used in this model:

- [Daily SKU Sales Dataset](data/sales_by_sku_daily.csv)  
- [Product Catalog & Margin Data](data/product_catalog.csv)

These datasets enable velocity calculations, revenue ranking, and profitability modeling.

## What This Demonstrates

- Data-driven revenue acceleration strategy
- Practical SKU rationalization methodology
- Executive-ready modeling framework
- Strategic pivot capability grounded in analytics
