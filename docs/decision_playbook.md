# Decision Playbook — Revenue Acceleration

## Objective

Translate SKU velocity and margin insights into repeatable operational actions that drive measurable revenue growth.

---

## Step 1 — Identify Revenue Drivers

Weekly review:

- Top 20% revenue-contributing SKUs
- Top margin-weighted velocity SKUs
- Underperforming inventory segments

Key question:
Which products meaningfully move total revenue?

---

## Step 2 — Adjust Exposure

Increase visibility of high-impact SKUs through:

- Menu positioning
- Placement strategy
- Upsell scripting
- Promotional emphasis

Reduce exposure of:

- Low-velocity, low-margin inventory
- Capital-heavy underperforming SKUs

---

## Step 3 — Align Incentives

Revenue acceleration requires behavioral alignment.

Examples:
- Commission multipliers for high-margin categories
- Incentives for upsell performance
- Recognition tied to margin contribution

This shifts staff focus from volume to contribution.

---

## Step 4 — Monitor Weekly Impact

Track:

- Revenue per SKU
- Category mix %
- Margin-weighted contribution
- Weekly revenue delta

Adjust exposure based on observed performance.

---

## Scaling Framework

This decision model is designed to scale across:

- Multiple locations
- Diverse inventory profiles
- Variable traffic environments

Because it relies on relative contribution metrics, not static thresholds.

---

## Core Principle

Revenue growth is not achieved by selling more of everything.

It is achieved by selling more of the right things.

Strategic mix optimization creates disproportionate revenue acceleration without proportional cost increases.
