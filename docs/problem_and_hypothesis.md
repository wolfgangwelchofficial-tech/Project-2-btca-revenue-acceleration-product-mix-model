# Problem & Hypothesis

## Problem

Revenue growth plateaued due to:

- Misalignment between product exposure and demand
- Overweight inventory in low-velocity SKUs
- Incentive structures not aligned to margin contribution
- Decision-making focused on volume rather than profitability

Despite steady traffic, revenue acceleration required structural mix optimization.

## Hypothesis

Revenue can be accelerated without increasing traffic by:

1. Identifying high margin-weighted velocity SKUs
2. Increasing exposure of top-performing categories
3. Reducing capital allocation to low-velocity inventory
4. Aligning staff incentives with margin contribution

If mix shifts are executed properly, total revenue and gross profit will increase disproportionately relative to unit growth.
